Howdy,
I'm Ananya!
I'm a student at Stanford who previously worked at Elon Musk's Neuralink and currently am doing commodities trading at Mercuria, and building & selling AI products.

I also invest in startups through Dorm Room Fund, and through my own fund, youtube occasionally: @ananyachadha, and speak at conferences globally like Fortune Brainstorm Finance, Websummit, EDCON, DEVCON & have been featured for my projects on Discovery Channel, CBC News, Global News and more.

Hope you have a great day!
