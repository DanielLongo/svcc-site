Hey there,

I'm Santiago. I grew up as an actor in Mexico and worked in over 20 shows and movies. Life has since taken me in different paths and now I am an undergraduate at Stanford studying Computer Science and Bioengineering. Some things about me:

- Built two companies before college: a Khan Academy meets Netflix for the Mexican high school system, and a platform for automatic data extraction (think Rossum AI).
- Worked on a mix of software engineering and product at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Cresta](https://cresta.com) and [Pioneer](https://pioneer.app).
- I'm spending time looking for and investing in early stage founders through [Dorm Room Fund](https://dormroomfund.com).
- On the personal side, I really like playing soccer (like a lot), making coffee and biking.
