Hi,

I’m a scientist and engineer excited by the ways computation allows us to take better decisions in experimental biology. Currently, I do research in generative modeling of sub-cellular protein localizations at the [Lundberg Lab](https://cellprofiling.org/).

My other passion is Stanford’s founder community. I run [Cardinal Ventures](cardinalventures.org), the only cross-department/program startup accelerator on campus. Our alumni have raised $500M+ and include [Mammoth Biosciences](mammoth.bio), [Athelas](athelas.com), and [Nova Credit](novacredit.com). Over the last year, I’ve been especially excited to add deep tech fellowships for PhD students and professors, and diversity outreach with Stanford community centers as part of our flagship programs.

Previously, I was the cofounder of Dealdock, an NLP-enabled deal flow management platform for private equity firms acquired by [Thoughfocus](https://thoughtfocus.com/), and did [research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3503222.3507726) on hardware acceleration of machine learning in computer networks.
