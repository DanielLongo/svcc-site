- **Senior year**. [POMDPs](https://cs238.stanford.edu), [tech ethics](https://cs182.stanford.edu), psycholinguistics, perceptual neuroscience, Iranian cuisine.
- **Reading**. Across genres, recently [Dostoyevsky and some non-fiction](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101516811-shan-reddy).
- **This wonderful club**. We aim to cultivate the highest-potential future technologists at Stanford.
