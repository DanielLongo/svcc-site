Hi,

I currently live in Palo Alto and study [symbolic systems](symsys.stanford.edu). I grew up in Las Vegas and previously worked at [Cometeer](cometeer.com).

Things I'm also involved in and spending time on (in order of priority, updated Jan. 2023):
- **Senior year**. [POMDPs](cs238.stanford.edu), [tech ethics](cs182.stanford.edu), psycholinguistics, perceptual neuroscience, Iranian cuisine.
- **Reading**. Across genres, recently [Dostoyevsky and some non-fiction](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101516811-shan-reddy).
- **This wonderful club**. We aim to cultivate the highest-potential future technologists at Stanford.
- **Investing**. [Marriage Pact](marriagepact.com), [TuMeke.io](www.tumeke.io), [MoonPay](moonpay.com), [Anduril](anduril.com), [Integral](https://useintegral.com/), [Fizz](https://fizzsocial.app/)
- **Educational equity**. Helping to establish [K-12 schooling](https://www.promisevillageacademy.org/) for Maasai children in Tanzania.
