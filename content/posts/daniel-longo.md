Hi,

I’m a technical undergrad with a passion for building products and leveraging ML. Currently, I’m building human in the loop ML based optimizations for ecommerce storefronts at Armadillo Labs with my cofounder Yash.

In the past, I’ve worked in edtech building learning tools used by over 70k students and have developed ML models in the healthcare setting.
