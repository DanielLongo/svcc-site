I’m Vincent, a proud 🍁 studying [Earth Systems](https://earth.stanford.edu/ess) at Stanford. I care alot about getting more rocks out of the ground, hopefully in North America.

Previously, I did product at [Wispr AI](https://www.wispr.ai/), a neurotechnology company backed by NEA and 8VC building the next generation of human computer interfaces. Before that, I led the growth team at [Umba](https://www.umba.com/), an Africa focused neobank backed by Lachy Groom and Ludlow Ventures.

I lurk on Twitter @vincentjsong and [write sometimes](https://vincentsong.posthaven.com/). [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonvi/) is great too if that floats your boat.
