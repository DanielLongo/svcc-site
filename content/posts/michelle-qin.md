Hi! I’m Michelle, a coterm pursuing my B.S. & M.S. in Computer Science on the Artificial Intelligence track at Stanford. Here’s a bit about me:

- Interested in entrepreneurship (of course), AI/ML, public policy, and social impact
- I love being the co-president of SVCC. By far the smartest, kindest, and most driven community.
- I also love doing AI research at these 2 places:
- Medical AI research to detect chest x-ray pathologies using CLIP at Professor Pranav Rajpurkar’s [Harvard Medical AI lab](https://www.rajpurkarlab.hms.harvard.edu/)
- Tech policy research to monitor methane emissions from CAFOs using CNNs at Professor Daniel Ho’s [Stanford RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu/)
- Free time: I love art/design, hot yoga, reading (active on GoodReads--profile here), and any way I can spend the day out in the sun!
- How to connect: Twitter [@michelleqin\_](https://twitter.com/michelleqin_) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-qin/)
