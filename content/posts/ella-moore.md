Hi there,

I’m Ella! I’m studying Biomedical Computation (Cellular/Molecular track) with a lifelong mission to address unmet clinical needs via entrepreneurship. I got my first taste of VC on the Bio team at Insight Partners and loved it so much that I’ll be returning to Insight this summer.

Currently:

Co-founding Wheal, a project my team and I spun out of the Chem-H Undergraduate Entrepreneurship Program
Working at the intersection of neuroscience and immunology in the Barron Lab
Investigating the thermostability of lipoproteins in the Sharaf Lab
Co-leading the volunteer team at Stanford Planned Parenthood

In my free time, you can find me in/on/around the water. Some of these pursuits have included surfing, diving, lifeguarding, and rowing for Stanford Lightweight Crew.

I would love to meet you; reach out on linked in or at emoore26@stanford.edu!
