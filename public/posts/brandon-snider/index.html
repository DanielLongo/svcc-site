    <p>Hey — I’m Brandon.</p>
<p>I grew up surfing, kiteboarding, and coding in Cape Town, South Africa. Before Stanford, I built a suite of market research and analytics tools for e-commerce brands, which grew into a bootstrapped SaaS business with 10,000+ users and $2M ARR, before I sold it.</p>
<p>For two whirlwind years, I lived in and worked from Mauritius — a tiny tropical island just east of Madagascar where I got hooked on fiery foods, immersed myself in nature, and (of course) shipped like crazy.</p>
<p>I’m now a CS undergraduate at Stanford University studying Computer Science with an AI focus, hacking on projects with novel tech, and searching for outlier founders to invest in.</p>
